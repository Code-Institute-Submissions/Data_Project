# Google PlayStore Download Data and Charts

On the following project you can see data about Google Store downloads apps. The charts represented are comparing 
and relating different aspects of the variety of downloaded apps from Google PlayStore.

## Getting Started

To be able to enjoy all the charts together is advice to used a desktop viewport so a full view of 
all charts: relations and comparisions will be possible.

This comaprision can be observed by clicking in one of the charts and see how this affects the rest of 
charts.


## Motivation

What really motivated me to do make this charts was the curiosity to see wht type of apps were downloaded more and 
what age group was more interested on which type of apps.

This project exists so people could learn more about what type of apps are dowloaded the most.

This project has been created to help: 
1. Developers to make their apps knowing the interest of their public.
2. Marketing: to know who are the most porpular app nowadasys.
3. Curios people who would liket to find out more about Google Play Store Downloads Apps
